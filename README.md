# 5463 Final Project: Path Drawing in Task Space

This project is the final project of ECE 5463. The project uses a mechanical arm composed of two rotating joints to achieve movement along a trajectory. Users can generate movement trajectories in two ways: one is to generate a specified trajectory with a single key press, and the other is to draw a custom trajectory on the screen.
The environment in which the project runs is as follows:
* Platform: Windows 11
* Python 3.13.7
* numpy 2.3.4
*	matplotlib 3.10.7

The following is the demonstration of the project:
